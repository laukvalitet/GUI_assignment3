# Instructions:
   1. Add a system environment variable named "ModelDb" with your database ConnectionString. Alternatively you can change the ConnectionString parameter in the ModelsApi. This can be found in: 
   ModelsApi --> StartUp.cs 
   2. Run the ModelsApi Project. 
   3. Execute "npm run serve" in the "web-app" Vue-project. Note that the Vue-project expects the API to be on port 5001. If this is not the case, change the port URL of API in:
   web-app --> components --> shared --> fetch.js
   4. Use ModelTron2000. Note that the database is seeded with a manager, with the following credentials:
   UserName: boss@m.dk
   Password: asdfQWER
